# binomialheap
A basic implementation of both a Binomial and a Binary Heap in Rust for purposes of comparing their asymptotic run times.  I am aware the Rust standard library has an implementation of BinaryHeap already.  Implementing the BinaryHeap on my own was a way to help familiarize myself with the langauge while working on a familiar concept before launching into the BinomialHeap.
