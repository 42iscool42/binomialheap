# binomialheap
A basic implementation of both a Binomial and a Binary Heap in Rust for purposes of comparing their asymptotic run times.  I am aware the Rust standard library has an implementation of BinaryHeap already.  Implementing the BinaryHeap on my own was a way to help familiarize myself with the langauge while working on a familiar concept before launching into the BinomialHeap.

To see the run time data collected on these two data structres, check out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13M_QgYNuPH6mW314i-2CFswvwOjOE8PIM_EoN91Wb2M/edit?usp=sharing).
